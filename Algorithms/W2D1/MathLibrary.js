//Dice Roller
//Using what we've learned about the Math library in JavaScript, complete the following function that should return a value between 1 through 6 at random.
function d6() {
    // My answer
    var roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    // your code here
    // true answer is var roll = Math.random(); ***** math.floor(roll)*6+1
    // Should return on INTEGER between 1 and 6 (inclusive)

    console.log(roll)    
    return roll;

// (this is for running it 100 times) ***for (var i = i; i <=100; i++)*** {   
var playerRoll = d6();
console.log("The player rolled: " + playerRoll);
